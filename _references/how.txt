If you still need some help on how to execute the simos.exe program 
(my single process version), below are some hints.
But you should read the program code and the handouot to understand
simOS in depth.

$ ./simos.exe
command> s
Submission file: prog.1
...
command> x
...

now you can type in those dump commands to observe the state of various 
data structures of the system,
or inputing x to continue executing prog.1,
or inputing s to submit another program.

Output of the programs are in terminal.out.
